## Band structure model

The transport model assumes a single isotropic parabolic band:

E(k) = ħ²k² / (2m*E)

This dispersion is explicitly plotted in `bandstructure.py`
to demonstrate consistency between the assumed band structure,
velocity expression, and density of states used in transport
calculations.
